            <p>
            The celebration lasted through the night, but with dawn came William's inevitable pronouncement: "We need to survey properly. We can't build a community on assumptions."
            </p>
            <p>
            Some groaned—couldn't they just enjoy paradise for one day?—but most understood. Their journey had taught them the value of careful observation. What seemed perfect at first glance might hide fatal flaws, as the slot canyon had proven.
            </p>
            <p>
            "But thiss time," Sarel added, seeing the mood deflate, "we survey not to eliminate, but to undersstand. We're not looking for reasonss to leave. We're learning how to sstay."
            </p>
            <p>
            This reframing changed everything. They weren't desperate searchers anymore but new residents learning their home. The energy shifted from reluctant duty to eager exploration.
            </p>
            <p>
            William had spent the early morning scratching survey forms into smooth bark—not the anxious tallies of their searching days, but thoughtful tools for understanding. Categories for tree density, undergrowth types, water access, soil conditions, existing wildlife signs, and something new: "Community Potential."
            </p>
            <p>
            "We'll divide into teams," he explained as the group gathered. "Each team takes a section. We're not just counting resources—we're imagining neighborhoods."
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 1: Organized Wonder</div>
            <p>
            The survey teams spread through the bosque like investigators of abundance. Each group had a mix of skills—sharp eyes, strong diggers, careful note-takers. William had learned from their journey that diverse teams found more than specialized ones.
            </p>
            <p>
            His own team included Gil, two young iguanas eager to learn, and surprisingly, Cornelius the packrat, whose scattered attention had proved valuable for noticing unexpected details.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Tree spacing," William announced, stretching a salvaged vine between two mesquite trunks. "Four of my body lengths between mature trees in this grove. Canopy overlap complete while paths stay clear."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Burrow potential high," Gil reported from ground level, testing soil with his claws. "Not too sandy, not too hard. Good drainage."
            </p>
            <p>
            The young iguanas scrambled up trunks, calling down observations about climbing routes and potential nest sites. Cornelius darted everywhere, collecting interesting objects but also noting things others missed—a hidden spring behind roots, a cave entrance covered by vines.
            </p>
            <p>
            "This isn't like Big Verde," one iguana said. "There, we had one tree. Here, we have... how many?"
            </p>
            <p>
            William consulted his growing notes, bark sheets already filling with observations. "This section alone? Forty-three mature mesquites, sixteen palo verdes, eight willows near the stream. And we've only surveyed perhaps one-twentieth of the total bosque."
            </p>
            <p>
            The numbers staggered them. After warring over shade scraps, such abundance defied comprehension.
            </p>
            <p>
            Meanwhile, Sarel's team traced water through the landscape. The main stream was just the beginning—springs bubbled from hidden rocks, seeps darkened soil, seasonal pools announced themselves through rushes and reeds. Each water source nurtured its own small world.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Sstudy these root patternss," Sarel's coils traced the visible roots breaking through soil. "They reach for water but don't choke each other. The treess learned to share. They take what they need without sstealing from neighborss."
            </p>
            <p>
            The plants themselves taught the lesson—sustainable community meant balanced use, not desperate grabbing. Take enough to thrive, leave enough for tomorrow.
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 2: Measuring More Than Trees</div>
            <p>
            As the day progressed, the surveys revealed the bosque's elegant design. The valley's shape created different zones—drier edges perfect for burrowers, moist center ideal for those needing constant water access, middle zones offering balance.
            </p>
            <p>
            "The land shaped itself for us," William's voice carried wonder as teams compared findings. "Burrowers have soft soil, climbers have highways, everyone has what they need."
            </p>
            <p>
            Challenges emerged alongside gifts. Dark stains high on bark warned of seasonal floods. Fresh claw marks—too large for their kind—suggested neighbors to respect. Some groves grew too dense for tortoise shells to navigate, others too sparse for small creatures seeking cover.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Flood seasonss will come," Sarel traced the high-water stains. "The bosque bendss with water insstead of breaking againsst it. We musst build the ssame way."
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil had been conducting his own investigation, reading the land through touch and patient observation. "Old settlements," he reported. "Three sites. Long abandoned but good bones. Can build on what was."
            </p>
            <p>
            This discovery excited William. Previous inhabitants meant tested locations, proven patterns they could learn from. He immediately wanted to investigate, to measure and map these old sites.
            </p>
            <p>
            "But firsst," Sarel suggested, "we finissh undersstaning the whole. Then we choosse where to focuss."
            </p>
            <p>
            The afternoon brought new teaching moments. Sarel gathered the younger creatures, showing them how to read the landscape systematically. "Sstart wide," she instructed. "Ssee the whole pattern. Then narrow focuss. Detailss matter, but only in context."
            </p>
            <p>
            She led them to a grove, coiling at its entrance. "Tell me what thiss place ssayss."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Trees," one youngster said. "Shade. Some rocks."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Deeper. The treess sspiral—that'ss wind teaching them to dance insstead of break. These rockss? Floodss arranged them into natural wallss. And notice—wesstern shade growss thickesst where afternoon ssun burnss hottesst."
            </p>
            <p>
            William recognized the lesson—their hard-won scout mindset transformed into cultural inheritance. What desperation had forced them to learn, abundance would let them perfect and pass on.
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 3: Community Science</div>
            <p>
            The survey teams reconvened as shadows lengthened, each group eager to share discoveries. The assembled data painted a picture of abundance beyond their dreams, but also complexity requiring thought.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Total mesquite trees in surveyed areas: over three hundred," William reported, his voice awed. "Estimated total in the full bosque: thousands. Permanent water sources: seven confirmed, more likely. Suitable denning sites: numerous. Food plants: abundant and varied."
            </p>
            <p>
            "But alsso," Sarel's tail swept toward the warning signs, "sseasonal challengess await. Floodss to resspect or relocate from. Predator pathss to acknowledge. Thiss issn't empty paradisse—it'ss a living ssystem inviting uss to join itss dance."
            </p>
            <p>
            The old tortoise emerged from examining ruins, dust coating his ancient shell. "Those who came before read this land truly. See—they built above flood reach, created sight lines against hunters, shared rather than hoarded. Their wisdom waits in these stones."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Tomorrow we map the old sites properly," William decided. "Learn what worked, what didn't. Build on success rather than starting fresh."
            </p>
            <p>
            But the most important measurement wasn't in William's neat columns of data. It was in the faces around him—no longer desperate refugees but creatures envisioning futures. The survey had revealed not just resources but possibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Teaching groves," someone suggested, eyes bright with possibility. "Where youngsters learn what the journey taught us."
            </p>
            <p>
            "And gathering spaces," another added. "Not just for survival meetings but for celebration."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Archives," William said dreamily. "To preserve our journey records, our methods. So future generations understand how we got here."
            </p>
            <p>
            They were measuring more than trees now. They were measuring dreams made possible by abundance, planning communities rather than just survival.
            </p>
            <p>
            As evening settled over the bosque, teams continued reporting. Each discovery built on others, creating a multidimensional understanding of their new home. The scientific method they'd developed through desperation was becoming a tool for thoughtful growth.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Something worries me," a young voice piped up. "This place overflows with everything we need. Will we forget the desert's teachings? Grow soft?"
            </p>
            <p>
            William touched his water-stained journal, its pages chronicling failures and desperate innovations. His new notes sang a different song—measurements of plenty instead of lack. "We'll remember," he said firmly. "Because we'll keep measuring, keep observing, keep teaching. The scout mindset isn't just for finding—it's for keeping."
            </p>
            <p>
            "And improving," Sarel added. "The bosque iss wonderful, but we can make it better. Not by changing it, but by undersstaning it sso deeply we become part of itss ssuccess."
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil, typically quiet during planning sessions, rumbled agreement. "Trees teach patience through seasons. Water teaches persistence through stone. All things teach those who listen."
            </p>
            <p>
            The day's survey had transformed vague abundance into specific understanding. They knew where floods reached, where shade persisted, where communities could root. But more importantly, they'd transformed from desperate seekers into thoughtful inhabitants.
            </p>
            <p>
            Tomorrow they would begin choosing specific sites, planning actual buildings. But today's measuring had given them the foundation—not just data about trees and water, but a methodology for understanding place deeply.
            </p>
            <p>
            Stars peeked through the canopy's lace as William scratched final observations by ember-glow. Columns of numbers filled pages, but between them he'd written observations that no measurement could capture: "Home is not just found but understood." "Abundance requires wisdom." "We measure not to judge but to join."
            </p>
            <p>
            Night sounds filled the bosque—rustling, chirping, the splash of unseen swimmers. After the desert's hollow silence, this symphony of life overwhelmed the senses. Water's voice wove through all, constant as breathing. And forty-three former refugees rested with the satisfaction of scientists who'd made the most important discovery: they belonged here.
            </p>
            <p>
            The trees had been measured. Now it was time to earn their shade.
