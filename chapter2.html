            <p>
            The afternoon heat had become a living thing, pressing down on the desert with suffocating weight. Even in the deepest shade of Big Verde, the air hung thick and heavy. William huddled in his burrow entrance, only his nose poking out, his whiskers trembling as they caught the strange currents in the air.
            </p>
            <p>
            Three days had passed since that morning of hot winds and small broken branches. Three days of temperatures that climbed higher than any early summer he could remember. His carefully scratched records on the flat stone showed the terrifying progression—each day hotter than the last, each night failing to bring the usual cooling relief.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Eighty-seven," he muttered, counting for the third time. "Eighty-seven seeds in my emergency cache now. Plus the forty-three in the main store. Plus the eighteen mesquite pods if properly rationed..." The numbers usually comforted him, but today they felt fragile as spider silk.
            </p>
            <p>
            Above, the sky had taken on a strange, bruised quality. Not the clear, harsh blue of the past days, but something dense and purple-gray, like old shed skin. The air vibrated with tension.
            </p>
            <p>
            From her coiled position on a thick branch, Sarel's tongue flicked rapidly, sampling the charged particles in the air. The pressure was dropping—her scales loosened and tightened in response, each one adjusting to the atmospheric change. "Ssstorm," she said quietly, though no one was near enough to hear. "But ssstrange..."
            </p>
            <p>
            The desert had gone eerily quiet. No birds sang. No lizards scurried. Even the eternal buzz of insects had ceased. The silence pressed against them all—that breathless pause before something momentous.
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil remained motionless beneath Big Verde, but his eyes were fully open now—a rarity during afternoon heat. The beaded texture of his skin pressed against the earth, reading vibrations through each raised scale. Through his belly scales, the earth transmitted its warnings—pressure changes, electrical charge building, something approaching from the southeast with unusual speed.
            </p>
            <p>
            "They know," he rumbled, watching a family of ground squirrels frantically carrying extra seeds to their deepest burrows. Even Cornelius—who'd lost three fortresses to storms in his younger years—had stopped building and was desperately anchoring what remained with strips of barrel cactus skin.
            </p>
            <p>
            William emerged fully from his burrow, his quills already half-raised with anxiety. "Did you feel that?" he called, his quills rattling with each word. "The ground... trembled."
            </p>
            <p>
            Not the ground—thunder, so distant it came as vibration rather than sound. But unlike the dry thunder of superheated air they'd heard recently, this carried the promise—or threat—of water.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Monsoon," Gil said. One word. Enough.
            </p>
            <p>
            "But it's too early!" William's voice pitched higher with each word. "Monsoons come in July, sometimes late June, but this is barely—" Another rumble, closer now, cut him off.
            </p>
            <p>
            Sarel flowed down from her branch with unusual haste. "This isss no ordinary monsoon," she said, joining her friends in the relatively open area beneath Big Verde's canopy. "The air tassstess wrong. Too much energy. Too fasst."
            </p>
            <p>
            The wind began. Not the steady blow of a normal storm approach, but something fitful and strange—gusts from different directions, swirling dust into small devils that spun between the cacti. The temperature plummeted, making William's quills stand rigid and clatter against each other like dry mesquite pods.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Inside." Gil's voice carried rare command. "Now."
            </p>
            <p>
            But William stood frozen, watching his territory. "My stones! The markers—And the seed cache entrance, if it floods—" He darted forward, trying to secure things that couldn't be secured against what was coming.
            </p>
            <p>
            "William!" Sarel's voice carried unusual sharpness. "There'ss no time!"
            </p>
            <p>
            The sky had darkened with frightening speed. What had been purple-gray was now black as scorched earth, roiling with internal lightning that lit the clouds from within. The wind intensified, no longer gusting but howling, bending the arms of saguaros and sending anything loose tumbling across the desert floor.
            </p>
            <p>
            William's neat pile of mesquite pods scattered like startled quail. His seventeen marking stones might as well have been feathers for all the good their weight did them. His carefully ordered world dissolved in heartbeats, a high keen escaping his throat.
            </p>
            <p>
            "WILLIAM!" Both Sarel and Gil called together.
            </p>
            <p>
            The first raindrops struck like thrown stones. Not the gentle patter of a normal storm's beginning, but immediate violence—drops so large and forceful they kicked up dust where they struck. Within heartbeats, the deluge began.
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 2: Impact</div>
            <p>
            William scrambled for cover just as the sky split open. The rain came in sheets so thick the saguaro twenty lengths away vanished. It hammered down with a roar that drowned out everything else, turning the dry earth to instant mud, creating rivers where moments before there had been only sand.
            </p>
            <p>
            The three friends pressed against Big Verde's trunk, but even the tree's thick canopy couldn't protect them from rain that came from all directions at once. The wind drove it sideways, upward, in spirals that defied logic.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Microbursst!" Sarel's hiss cut through the roar, her tongue tasting what she'd feared. These localized downpours could dump months of rain in minutes, could generate winds that snapped saguaros like twigs, could transform peaceful washes into raging torrents without warning.
            </p>
            <p>
            Big Verde groaned. They felt it through their bones—a deep creaking of wood pushed beyond endurance. Its branches whipped wildly, leaves torn away in clawfuls. The trunk itself swayed—or perhaps that was William's panicked vision, his world tilting.
            </p>
            <p>
            Lightning struck close—close enough that the thunder came with the flash, close enough that Sarel's tongue recoiled from the metallic air, that William's quills stood rigid as cactus spines, that Gil's beaded skin tightened against his frame. The flash illuminated a scene from nightmare: Cornelius's fortress collapsing, sticks flying like spears; a barrel cactus, centuries old, toppling slowly into the mud; the wash already running bank-full with chocolate-colored water that carried along everything in its path.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Branch!" Gil's single word carried more urgency than a rattlesnake's warning.
            </p>
            <p>
            Big Verde's largest lower branch, the one that provided their best shade, bent at an impossible angle. The wood was screaming—a high, tearing sound audible even over the storm's fury.
            </p>
            <p>
            "It's going to—" William began.
            </p>
            <p>
            CRACK!
            </p>
            <p>
            The sound split the air—sharp, final, world-ending. The branch tore free from the trunk, taking with it chunks of bark and smaller branches. It twisted as it fell, its weight tremendous, its trajectory aimed directly at the spot where they'd held their morning gatherings.
            </p>
            <p>
            They scattered. Even Gil moved with startling speed, his thick tail whipping behind him as his claws dug for purchase in the sudden mud. The branch crashed down with earth-shaking force, its impact sending up a spray of mud and debris. Where once there had been carefully maintained common ground, now there was only destruction.
            </p>
            <p>
            The rain continued its assault, but the wind was already beginning to ease. Microbursts struck like that—savage but brief, all their violence compressed into minutes that stretched like hours. The deluge softened to merely torrential, then heavy rain, then something more normal.
            </p>
            <p>
            But the damage was done.
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 3: After</div>
            <p>
            As quickly as it had come, the storm moved on. The black clouds rolled northwest, leaving behind a sky of innocent blue and a desert transformed. Water still ran in sheets across the ground, pooling in every depression, turning the familiar landscape alien.
            </p>
            <p>
            William stood in shock, water dripping from his quills, staring at the chaos that had been his orderly world. His marking stones were gone—scattered or buried. The flat rock where he'd kept his temperature records was covered in mud. His carefully maintained burrow entrance was a gaping hole rapidly filling with runoff.
            </p>
            <p>
            "My home," he whispered, counting his quills—a nervous habit. "Everything... all of it..."
            </p>
            <p>
            Sarel's head wove back and forth, her tongue gathering information from a dozen directions at once. Her favorite observation branch was intact, but many others were gone. The patterns she'd memorized, the pathways she'd mapped—all changed in minutes. "We sssurvived," she said, but her coils tightened—betraying uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil pressed his broad head against the fallen branch, his throat sensing vibrations that told of healthy wood torn too soon. The wood was white and raw where it had torn, sap already beginning to well up like blood from a wound. "Not dead." His claws scraped the raw break. "Strong. Should have held."
            </p>
            <p>
            They understood. This branch hadn't fallen from age or disease. It had been healthy, vital, the heart of their shade-giving canopy. If it could fall, what else might they lose?
            </p>
            <p>
            Around them, the desert emerged from shock. Cornelius poked his head out from a deep crevice, chittering in distress at his scattered fortress. The desert iguanas emerged from their flooded burrows, looking dazed. The ancient tortoise sat in a puddle, each slow blink marking time like seasons passing.
            </p>
            <p>
            "The shade," William said suddenly, his mind already calculating angles and coverage. "Look at it. Look at what we've lost."
            </p>
            <p>
            Where Big Verde's canopy had once cast a generous pool of shade, now harsh sunlight streamed through the gap left by the fallen branch. What had been cool refuge would, by tomorrow's noon, be as hot as the open desert.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We can adapt," Sarel said quickly, tasting the salt of William's panic-sweat on the air. "We've faced challengers before. We—"
            </p>
            <p>
            "No." William's voice was flat. "Not like this. This changes everything. The temperature differential, the square footage of usable shade, the protection from afternoon sun—" His voice broke. "I had it all calculated. All planned. And now..."
            </p>
            <p>
            Thunder grumbled in the distance as the storm moved on, leaving them with its aftermath. The desert smelled of wet earth and broken vegetation, a scent that usually meant renewal but now spoke only of loss.
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil approached Big Verde's trunk, pressing his textured hide against the wound where the branch had torn away. The wound was massive, exposing the tree's inner wood to elements it had been protected from for decades. "Needs watching." Each word deliberate. "Disease. Beetles. Rot."
            </p>
            <p>
            Four words. For Gil, a lengthy discourse—and it carried the weight of prophecy.
            </p>
            <p>
            Sarel coiled herself tightly, a sign of deep thought. "The otherss will panic," she observed, her tongue already detecting the fear-scent beginning to rise. "Without adequate shade, without organization..." She didn't need to finish. They all remembered the chaos after their last home fell—the battles over scraps, the shattered alliances, the desperate flights into unknown territory.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Eighty-seven seeds," William muttered, already reverting to his numbers for comfort. "Forty-three in the main cache if it's not flooded. Eighteen mesquite pods scattered but possibly recoverable. Three friends. One partially destroyed tree. Zero workable plans." His laugh carried an edge of hysteria. "The count doesn't balance."
            </p>
            <p>
            The sun emerged through the dispersing clouds, its light fracturing through the countless water droplets that beaded every surface. The desert after rain was always transformed. But they saw only the harsh light streaming through where shade should be, illuminating a future suddenly uncertain.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We'll call a gathering," Sarel decided. "When everyone hass recovered from the shock. We'll assess, plan, organize—"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Organize what?" William's voice cracked, his quills clattering with agitation. "You can't organize away a missing branch. You can't plan your way past the sun's path. The heat doesn't negotiate."
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil placed a heavy claw on William's shoulder. "Breathe." Gil's voice rumbled up from deep in his throat. "Count. One. Two. Three."
            </p>
            <p>
            William's quills bristled with the need to argue, to rage against the senselessness of it all. But he breathed. One. Two. Three. The familiar rhythm slowly calming his racing heart, though his mind continued to spin with calculations of doom.
            </p>
            <p>
            As the afternoon wore on and the puddles began to shrink under the returning sun, the three friends remained by the fallen branch. Each carried their own thoughts, their own fears, their own desperate hopes that somehow, they could salvage what the storm had broken.
            </p>
            <p>
            But as the shadows shifted—all wrong now, with the gap in the canopy—each privately wondered if this marked the end of their life at Big Verde. The storm had passed, but its fracture lines ran deeper than just broken wood.
            </p>
            <p>
            The community that gathered that evening was subdued, fearful. The branch lay between them like a body at a funeral, too heavy to move, too painful to ignore. And above, Big Verde's wounded trunk wept sap in the fading light, each amber drop marking time like William's careful counts—but counting toward an end, not a beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
            Change had come, violent and sudden as the storm itself. And in its wake, everything they'd built felt as fragile as William's scattered stones, as precarious as Cornelius's fallen fortress, as vulnerable as a tree with a gaping wound where its strength used to be.
