            <p>
            Morning light filtered through leaves as the council assembled in their chosen amphitheater—fallen logs forming natural benches, branches weaving shelter overhead. William's bark surveys lay spread across a flat stone, pebbles anchoring each precious sheet. Sarel coiled high enough to survey all, while Gil's bulk provided the solid center that drew others close.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We have seventeen potential sites," William began, consulting his meticulous notes. "Each with advantages and challenges. We need to choose not just for now, but for the future."
            </p>
            <p>
            The journey had taught them to think beyond immediate needs. A perfect site for summer might flood in winter. A spot ideal for small creatures might not accommodate growth. They needed to choose wisely.
            </p>
            <p>
            "First criterion," Sarel said, "flood safety. Show us the high-water marks again."
            </p>
            <p>
            William unrolled a bark map etched with careful symbols. The flood patterns revealed themselves in dark lines—here, winter lakes would form; there, only morning dew would gather. The previous inhabitants had read these signs too, their ruins clustering only where water respected boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
            "The tri-mesquite hollow," the old tortoise's voice carried the weight of careful study. "Northern section. Three ancients who chose to grow as one, their joining creating shelter between. The land rises there—floods bow before it."
            </p>
            <p>
            Several creatures had scouted this location. It was one of the old settlement sites, abandoned but structurally sound. The three mesquites had grown so close their trunks partially merged, creating a sheltered hollow between them like a natural room.
            </p>
            <p>
            "My measurements confirm safety," William traced the elevations on his map. "Three full body lengths above the highest flood scar. Water flows away naturally. The trees' bark bears no wound from rising water."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Defense favors us there," added a ground squirrel, her vigilance sharpened since the coyote night. "Single main approach for visitors, clear views in all directions, but bolt-holes plenty if trouble comes calling."
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 1: Democratic Evaluation</div>
            <p>
            They'd learned that imposed decisions created resentment, while inclusive choices built commitment. So they organized scouts to visit the top three sites, with everyone encouraged to participate.
            </p>
            <p>
            The first alternative was a grove near the stream—beautiful, convenient to water, but William's flood data showed concerning patterns. The second was a rocky outcrop with caves—defensible but limited in expansion potential.
            </p>
            <p>
            Then they visited the tri-mesquite hollow as a group.
            </p>
            <p>
            The three ancients rose like pillars carved by time itself, their fused trunks forming a living wall. Between them, the hollow stretched ten body lengths across—intimate but not cramped. Earth rose gently inward from all directions, channeling water away. Above, branches wove so tightly that entering felt like stepping into a verdant cave.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Oh," breathed a young iguana. "It's like it was made for us."
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil pressed both claws against the massive trunks, reading their history through bark and heartwood. "Ancient beyond counting," his rumble held reverence. "Roots drink from deep rivers. These three will outlive our great-grandchildren's grandchildren."
            </p>
            <p>
            William paced off distances, but joy replaced his usual worried precision. "The hollow's heart holds all of us. Personal spaces spiral outward like petals. Privacy where the roots divide, community where the canopy merges."
            </p>
            <p>
            Sarel climbed the trees, testing branches and sight lines. "Excellent observation posts. And see—the canopy has layers. Ground dwellers below, climbers above, all sharing the same protective umbrella."
            </p>
            <p>
            Cornelius's packrat nature led him to the deciding discovery. "Treasures!" he chittered, whiskers quivering with excitement. "The old ones left gifts!"
            </p>
            <p>
            The previous inhabitants had prepared for successors. Hidden caches revealed themselves—stones shaped for building, hardwood beams seasoned by time, grass ropes that held firm despite the seasons. Each cache carefully placed where weather couldn't reach.
            </p>
            <p>
            "They knew others would come," the old tortoise's voice dropped to near-whisper. "They built not just for themselves but for us, the ones they'd never meet."
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 2: Collective Decision</div>
            <p>
            The formal decision-making happened that evening, but the outcome was already clear. The tri-mesquite hollow had chosen them as much as they'd chosen it.
            </p>
            <p>
            "All in favor?" Sarel asked, though she knew the answer.
            </p>
            <p>
            The response was unanimous. Not just agreement but enthusiasm. They'd found not just a site but a place that felt destined.
            </p>
            <p>
            "But we build differently than Patchwork Place," William's claw traced patterns in the dust. "Not temporary shelter but generation homes. We shape ourselves to the land, not the land to us."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Individual spaces and communal areas," Sarel added. "Privacy and community both."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Build with floods," Gil contributed. "Not against them. Like the trees do."
            </p>
            <p>
            The planning session that followed was unlike their desperate sessions at Big Verde. There, they'd planned from scarcity. Here, they planned from abundance. The question wasn't "how do we survive?" but "how do we thrive?"
            </p>
            <p>
            William's dirt drawings grew richer as voices joined in. The hollow's center would stay clear—their heartspace, their dance ground. Around it, homes would tuck into root-caves and trunk-hollows, using what the trees had already shaped.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We don't build in this forest," Sarel's insight stopped them all. "We grow into it, like new branches on ancient trees."
            </p>
            <p>
            The young iguana who'd helped build Patchwork Place had been quiet, but now spoke up. "Could we... could we build teaching spaces? Places where we share what we learned?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Yes!" William's eyes lit up. "A proper archive for our journey records. Workshop areas for building skills. Maybe even performance spaces for stories."
            </p>
            <p>
            They sketched more than mere shelters—they designed a future. Abundance freed them from survival's narrow focus to dream of what their grandchildren might inherit.
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 3: Preparing the Future</div>
            <p>
            As plans solidified, they organized into working groups. Unlike the top-down organization of their past, these groups formed organically around interests and skills.
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil gathered the foundation-makers—those who knew that earth must be properly asked before building begins. His stone-steady presence drew others who understood that the unseen roots matter more than visible branches.
            </p>
            <p>
            Sarel wove between the design groups—those mapping daily paths, planning sightlines, dreaming where constructed and natural would marry. Her pattern-sense helped others see not just what was but what could be.
            </p>
            <p>
            William, surprisingly, turned from building plans to memory-keeping. He crafted systems to preserve not just what they built but why—capturing wisdom in bark and stone. The journey had taught him that forgotten knowledge crumbled faster than abandoned walls.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Rituals will root us," the old tortoise suggested, his ancient eyes seeing beyond the moment. "Ceremonies to carry our story, honor the brave who remained, mark the miracle of arrival."
            </p>
            <p>
            This sparked another thread of planning. The tri-mesquite hollow wouldn't just be where they lived but where they maintained their culture. The scout mindset that had brought them here needed to be preserved, taught, celebrated.
            </p>
            <p>
            Darkness wrapped around them but no one moved to leave. The hollow transformed in their mind's eye from empty to alive. William's sketches multiplied across bark sheets. Groups flowed like water, pooling around different dreams. Energy crackled between them—not desperation's sharp edge but purpose's steady flame.
            </p>
            <p>
            "When do we start?" someone asked.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We've already started," Sarel observed. "The choosing is the beginning. Tomorrow we clear. Next day we lay foundations. But tonight, we're already building—in our minds, our plans, our community."
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil had said little during the planning, but now he moved to one of the great trunks and placed both claws against it. "Trees sing welcome," he reported, pressing deeper against the bark. "They've been waiting for us."
            </p>
            <p>
            Perhaps trees couldn't truly speak. But the journey had taught them to trust Gil's deep listening. His certainty became theirs.
            </p>
            <p>
            The tri-mesquite hollow sat in starlight, empty but full of potential. Tomorrow, claws and teeth would shape wood and earth. But tonight, they'd done the harder work—weaving separate dreams into shared vision, binding forty-three souls into one purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
            William made final notes, trying to capture not just the practical decisions but the feeling of the evening. How did you document hope becoming plan becoming future? How did you record the moment when refugees became founders?
            </p>
            <p>
            "We'll call it Scout's Haven," the words appeared beneath his claw. "For the journey that shaped us, the watchfulness that saved us, the tomorrow we're planting today."
            </p>
            <p>
            The name hadn't been discussed, had simply appeared on his page. But when he shared it, the response was immediate agreement. Scout's Haven. A place found by those willing to look, built by those who'd learned to see.
            </p>
            <p>
            The hollow waited with the patience of its ancient guardians. Soon, life would fill every corner—walls would rise, paths would form, voices would echo. But tonight it cradled something equally precious: the dreams of creatures who'd discovered that when place, people, and purpose align, impossibility becomes inevitable.
            </p>
            <p>
            The choice was made. The building could begin.
