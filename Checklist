2. Individual Character Arcs (Start → Mid → End)
Character	Initial State	Mid-story Transformation	Endpoint
William (porcupine)	Fussy perfectionist; safety in routine.	Forced to face disorder & distance; adopts “record, test, adapt” pattern; first leadership tasks in Chap 21.	Confident systems-builder; accepts uncertainty; mentors others in orderly experimentation rather than rigid control.
Gil (Gila monster)	Slow, steady, content in narrow range; reactive not proactive.	Journey reveals his strength as stabiliser & protector; invents practical engineering fixes (bridge planks, ballast anchors).	Becomes physical and moral bulwark of Scout’s Haven; respected elder offering measured counsel.
Sarel (coachwhip)	Keen observer, solitary analyst, hesitant to direct.	Stakes push her into explicit strategist role; frames hypotheses, coordinates moves, negotiates with newcomers.	Recognised guide & planner; embodies “see clearly, act decisively”; teaches others the scout mindset openly.

3. Geographic Timeline
Chapter Range	Location	Key Movement Notes
1-2	Big Verde wash	Home base; branch loss.
3-6	Patchwork Place (near Great Saguaro)	50 m shift; first cooperative shelter, eventual failure.
7-10	5 km survey loop: Ironwood wash → Slot canyon → Pack-rat middens	Radial day-trips; return to Patchwork each night.
11-15	Long trek: down major arroyo, over Three Ridges plateau, across open desert plain	~30 km cumulative; 2 nights outbound; haboob en route.
16-24	Mesquite Bosque (“Scout’s Haven”)	Permanent relocation; internal expansions to satellite shelters; flood-safe design proven.

4. Implicit Lessons & Where They Surface
Lesson (implicit)	Manifestations (chapters)	Link to Character Arcs
Bravery ≠ recklessness	7 (decide quest), 14-15 (predator & storm nights), 22 (flood response)	William learns calculated risk; Gil demonstrates calm courage; Sarel frames risk-reward trade-offs.
Self-sufficiency through skill-building	4-5 (learn by failure), 12-13 (trek logistics), 17-18 (survey & design)	Trio acquires and then teaches survival engineering, replacing dependence on a single shade source.
Trust in friends’ complementary strengths	4-5 (first cooperation), 11-16 (journey pacing & scouting), 20-21 (delegate to community)	Each arc pivots on recognising others’ abilities—William defers to Sarel’s planning, Sarel trusts Gil’s endurance, Gil trusts William’s precision.
Scout mindset—observe reality, update beliefs	7-10 (site tests), 17 (canopy metrics), 23 (naming ceremony explanation)	Sarel embodies, William formalises via notes, Gil validates with tactile checks—modelled repeatedly without didactic statements.

The structure keeps tension rising, rewards empirical thinking, and lets readers internalise bravery, self-reliance, mutual trust, and open-minded curiosity through the protagonists’ earned growth rather than overt moralizing.
