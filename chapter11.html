            <p>
            The evening assembly had a different quality than previous gatherings. Word had spread quickly about the pack-rat rejection and Sarel's mention of the mesquite bosque. Creatures gathered not with the weary obligation of recent weeks, but with something sharper—curiosity mixed with wariness, hope tempered by trial.
            </p>
            <p>
            Sarel had spent the afternoon gathering every scrap of information about the bosque. She'd consulted the oldest residents, the newest arrivals, even Cornelius, whose packrat relatives might have carried whispers. Now she coiled atop the speaking stone, her posture conveying ceremony.
            </p>
            <p>
            "What I'm about to share," she began, "is not confirmed fact. It's compiled from stories, rumors, and fragments. But the consistency is... remarkable."
            </p>
            <p>
            William sat at the front, his expression unreadable. He'd spent the afternoon not planning or calculating, but resting beside Gil, tracking the sun's path across Big Verde's broken crown. Something had loosened in him during those still hours.
            </p>
            <p>
            "The mesquite bosque," Sarel continued, "is said to lie two days west, in a valley where underground water keeps the trees green year-round. The accounts describe canopies so interwoven that midday carries dusk's softness. Space for hundreds of creatures. Protection from storms."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Stories," the skeptical chuckwalla said, but with less venom than before. Even skeptics were running out of alternatives.
            </p>
            <p>
            "More than stories," Sarel insisted. "Three separate accounts mention the same landmark—a ridge of black volcanic rock that must be crossed. Two describe the same approach—through a canyon that smells of water. Most revealing..." She paused. "Five different creatures have mentioned relatives who went searching for it and never returned."
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 1: Gathering Evidence</div>
            <p>
            "Never returned because they died," someone suggested grimly.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Or never returned because they stayed," Sarel countered. "Think about it. If you found paradise after living in decline, would you make a dangerous journey back just to tell others?"
            </p>
            <p>
            An old desert tortoise, ancient beyond counting, stirred from where he'd been listening. "I knew one who returned," he said, his voice carrying the rasp of seasons over sandstone. "My mother's brother. Came back thin as a stick, feet worn to nothing. But his eyes..." The tortoise paused, remembering. "His eyes were different. Like he'd seen something worth the journey."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Why did he return?" William asked, the first he'd spoken.
            </p>
            <p>
            "To bring his family. But the rains failed that year. Harsh season. They chose to wait. By the next rains, his strength had ebbed too far for the journey. His final winter came soon after." The tortoise's aged eyes held theirs. "His last words were 'I should have stayed.'"
            </p>
            <p>
            The assembly absorbed this in silence. It carried truth's weight—not the tidy truth of kit-tales, but the ragged truth of lived experience.
            </p>
            <p>
            "I've been mapping the accounts," William announced, producing a strip of bark covered in his precise markings. "The landmarks align. The distances are consistent. The direction matches prevailing water flows from the mountains. Scientifically speaking..." He paused, then continued with obvious effort. "It's plausible."
            </p>
            <p>
            Murmurs rippled through the gathering. If William, master of doubt and calculation, found it plausible...
            </p>
            <p>
            "But the journey," a mother kangaroo rat said, pulling her pups closer. "Two suns across exposed desert. Hunters. Heat. No cover between here and there."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Certain death if we stay," Gil rumbled. "Possible death if we go. Better odds with possible."
            </p>
            <p>
            "It's not that simple," the mother protested. "You three are strong, capable. But the elderly? The young? Those of us who aren't built for long journeys?"
            </p>
            <p>
            This was the heart of it. Not whether the bosque existed, but whether they could reach it. The desert between here and there was unforgiving. Every creature knew someone who'd ventured into the open and never returned.
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 2: The Great Debate</div>
            <p>
            The discussion that followed was unlike any they'd had. Not the desperate scrambling of post-storm planning or the bitter arguments over shade, but something deeper. They were deciding whether to risk everything on hope.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We could send scouts first," someone suggested. "Confirm it exists before we all commit."
            </p>
            <p>
            "A scouting trip of that distance would take resources we can't spare," William countered. "And if they find paradise, do we wait here, degrading further, while they make another round trip?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "We could go in waves," another proposed. "Strongest first, to establish—"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Dividing makes us weaker," Sarel interrupted. "Predators pick off the separated. We learned that on—" She stopped, not wanting to invoke their traumatic past directly.
            </p>
            <p>
            The young iguana who'd helped build Patchwork Place stood. "I want to share something. Yesterday, I tried to rest in the shade where my parents used to bask. Where I emerged from the egg. Only bare, baked earth remains. I realized... Big Verde isn't home anymore. It's just where we're dying slowly."
            </p>
            <p>
            Her words landed like stones in still water, ripples of recognition spreading through the crowd.
            </p>
            <p>
            "But what if the bosque is another disappointment?" The question came from a ground squirrel who'd been on every failed expedition. "What if we use our last strength reaching another ironwood wash, another canyon furnace?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Then we perish attempting," Gil stated. "Better than perishing in place."
            </p>
            <p>
            The debate continued as stars emerged. Practical concerns mixed with philosophical questions. Risk assessment tangled with hope and fear. Through it all, William remained unusually quiet, scratching calculations in the dirt, erasing them, starting over.
            </p>
            <p>
            Finally, Sarel called for quiet. "We need to decide. Not whether the bosque is real—we can't know that without going. But whether we're willing to risk finding out."
            </p>
            <p>
            "I can't," a voice said quietly. It was William.
            </p>
            <p>
            Everyone turned to stare. After his earlier support of the plausibility, this reversal shocked them.
            </p>
            <p>
            "I can't," he repeated, louder. "I can't make this decision with logic. I can't calculate our odds of survival. I can't plan for every contingency." He stood, his quills trembling. "I've tried. I've run every number, every scenario. And the mathematics are clear—staying means certain slow death, going means probable quick death."
            </p>
            <p>
            The gathering deflated. If even William's numbers said—
            </p>
            <p>
            "But," he continued, and something in his voice made them all lean forward. "I can no longer exist by calculations alone. Gil taught me to count tomorrows, not catastrophes. Sarel taught me that discovery requires risk. And this dying tree taught me that sometimes, what we cling to is what's killing us."
            </p>
            <p>
            He looked around at his community—diminished, desperate, but still his community. "I can't promise we'll survive the journey. I can't guarantee the bosque is real. But I can do this." He took a deep breath. "I can choose hope over certainty. I can choose 'maybe' over 'definitely not.' I can choose to try."
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 3: The Turning Point</div>
            <p>
            The hush that followed pressed down like midday heat. William—methodical, wary, calculating William—had just chosen the ultimate unknown. If he could make that leap...
            </p>
            <p>
            "When?" The mother kangaroo rat's voice trembled but held firm. "When do we depart?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "You'll come?" Sarel couldn't hide her surprise.
            </p>
            <p>
            "I won't raise my pups in the shadow of death," she replied. "If there's even a chance of something better..."
            </p>
            <p>
            One by one, others began to speak. Not all in favor—some were too old, too afraid, too attached to even this diminished existence. But more than expected voiced willingness to try.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We need time to prepare," Sarel said, her leadership instincts taking over. "This isn't a day expedition. We need water carriers, food supplies, protection strategies—"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Five sunrises," William interrupted. "I've already mapped it through. Five sunrises to prepare properly. Those who are coming need time to ready. Those who are staying..." He paused. "Need time to say goodbye."
            </p>
            <p>
            The practicalities began to flow. Who could carry extra water. Who could scout. Who could help the slower movers. The roadrunner volunteered to make advance runs, caching supplies partway. The old tortoise offered his navigation expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We should go as one group," Gil advised. "Safer. Even if slower."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Dawn departure," Sarel added. "Travel in cool hours. Rest midday. Travel again in evening."
            </p>
            <p>
            "I'll create journey protocols," William said, falling back on his organizational skills. "But flexible ones. Adaptable to conditions we find."
            </p>
            <p>
            As the assembly scattered, the air thrummed with purpose unlike any since before the great limb fell. Not the manic desperation of crisis response or the grinding determination of failed expeditions, but something more sustainable. Purpose mixed with acceptance. Hope tempered by realism.
            </p>
            <p>
            The three friends remained as others left to begin preparations. They regarded each other truly, recognizing the distance traveled from that dawn when their world first split.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We might be leading them to their deaths," William said quietly.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Or to their lives," Sarel countered.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Mmmph," Gil agreed. "Worth finding out."
            </p>
            <p>
            Over the following days, Big Verde transformed into a place of purposeful activity. Those pledged to the journey prepared with purpose. Those staying helped, even while mourning the coming separation. A few who'd initially chosen to stay changed their minds, drawn by the community's determination.
            </p>
            <p>
            William's transformation was the most remarkable. He still planned obsessively, still counted and calculated. But now his plans included sections for "unexpected opportunities" and "intuitive decisions." His calculations factored in not just physical resources but community morale. He was discovering precision within uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>
            The night before departure, he stood at his old marking stones—the ones he'd obsessed over maintaining. Only four remained visible, the others buried or scattered. He studied them for a long breath, then deliberately scattered them with his paws.
            </p>
            <p>
            "No more markers," he said to the night. "No more holding to what was."
            </p>
            <p>
            Sarel found him there. "Regrets?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Many," William admitted. "But not about this choice. I've lived in fear of the unknown so long, I forgot the known was killing us."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Tomorrow, then," Sarel said. "Into the unknown."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Together," William added. "That's the only calculation that matters now."
            </p>
            <p>
            The stars wheeled overhead, navigation points for the journey ahead. Somewhere to the west, the mesquite bosque either waited or didn't. Reality or rumor. Salvation or final disappointment.
            </p>
            <p>
            But they would find out. Because sometimes, the courage to say "I can" in the face of "I can't" was the only mathematics that mattered. The decision was made. The community was committed.
            </p>
            <p>
            At sunrise, they would move into the unknown with clear sight and deliberately guarded hope.
            </p>
            <p>
            And William, who had learned to tally beyond disaster, would help guide them forward.
            </p>
            <p>
            The five sunrises passed in a blur of preparation. Water gourds were patched and tested. Food stores were divided into portable bundles. The roadrunner scouted the first day's route three times, memorizing every shadow and shelter. Gil organized carrying rotations with quiet efficiency. Sarel gathered final fragments of lore about their destination, each account adding another thread to their tapestry of hope. And William—William filled pages with flexible plans, contingency thoughts, and for the first time, margins marked simply "adapt as needed." When the fifth night deepened into the sixth dawn, they were as ready as desert creatures could be for a journey into the possible.
