# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a literary project - an AI-assisted novel writing proof-of-concept called "Scout's Haven". The goal is to test whether AI can generate a complete ~200-page novel in a single pass based on a detailed outline.

## Key Project Goals

1. **Maintain Narrative Consistency**: Keep track of plot points, character locations, and established facts across 24 chapters
2. **Execute Character Arcs**: Ensure character development aligns with predefined arcs
3. **Weave in Core Themes**: Subtly integrate themes of bravery, collaborative self-sufficiency, and "scout mindset"
4. **Translate Outline to Prose**: Convert structural outline into compelling, well-paced prose

## Writing Guidelines

### Style Reference
Use the sample chapters (1-6) in "Stylistic sample text from early drafts.txt" as the stylistic guide for:
- Narrative voice and tone
- Desert setting descriptions
- Character dialogue patterns
- Pacing and chapter structure

### Character Voices
- **William (Porcupine)**: Fussy, perfectionist speech; uses precise language
- **Gil (Gila Monster)**: Minimal speech, often just "Mmmph"; slow and deliberate
- **Sarel (Coachwhip)**: Soft, hissing speech with elongated 's' sounds; observant and strategic

### Chapter Structure
Each chapter should be approximately 8-10 pages and include:
- Ties to previous chapters (↩) and foreshadowing of future events (↪)
- Character development moments aligned with the arc progression
- Geographic consistency with the timeline in the Checklist

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Contains synopsis, character descriptions, and project goals
- **Checklist**: Detailed 24-chapter breakdown with:
  - Chapter titles and key events
  - Forward/backward chapter connections
  - Character development tracking
  - Geographic timeline
  - Implicit lessons and where they surface
- **Stylistic sample text from early drafts.txt**: Chapters 1-6 demonstrating desired writing style

## Common Tasks

### Writing Process for ALL Chapters (1-24)
Each chapter MUST follow this complete process:

#### Step 1: Pre-Writing
1. Review the Checklist for the chapter's key events and connections
2. Reference the geographic timeline to ensure location consistency
3. Check character arc progression for development moments
4. Use the stylistic sample as a guide for tone and pacing
5. Plan backward references (↩) and forward foreshadowing (↪)

#### Step 2: Writing in Three Parts
1. Part 1/3: Opening/Setup (pages 1-3)
2. Part 2/3: Development/Core Events (pages 4-6)
3. Part 3/3: Climax/Resolution/Transition (pages 7-9)

#### Step 3: MANDATORY Post-Chapter Audit/Edit
After completing EVERY chapter, perform a critical review:
1. **Pacing Check**: Ensure the story moves forward dynamically, avoiding static character blocks
2. **Backstory Audit**: Remove repetitive exposition; trust readers to connect dots
3. **Character Voice Consistency**: Verify each character speaks/acts authentically
4. **Length Verification**: Confirm 8-10 page target is met
5. **Desert Accuracy**: Check all flora/fauna references are authentic to Sonoran Desert
6. **Connection Review**: Verify backward/forward chapter ties are present and subtle

### Maintaining Consistency
- Track character locations and movements against the geographic timeline
- Ensure implicit lessons emerge naturally through action, not exposition
- Maintain the desert setting's authenticity with accurate flora/fauna references
- Keep character speech patterns consistent with established voices

## Important Notes

- This is a creative writing project, not a software development project
- Focus on narrative quality over technical implementation
- The "test" is whether the AI can maintain coherence across a full novel
- Avoid overt moralizing - lessons should be implicit through character actions
- **CRITICAL**: Every single chapter (1-24) must go through the complete 3-step process including the mandatory audit/edit step
- Never skip the audit step - it ensures consistent quality throughout the entire novel
