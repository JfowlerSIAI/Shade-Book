            <p>
            The slot canyon expedition departed under clouds—a rare blessing that brought cooler air and raised spirits. William had revised his marking patterns three times since the ironwood wash, adding new categories for vertical territories, echo patterns, and what he called "heat-holding measures."
            </p>
            <p>
            "The echo patterns alone could tell us about air movement," he explained to anyone within hearing. "And if we track heat differences between canyon floor and rim—"
            </p>
            <p>
            "William," Sarel said patiently, "perhaps save the teaching for when we actually see the canyon?"
            </p>
            <p>
            Their party was smaller this time—eight creatures instead of twelve. Some had been discouraged by the ironwood failure, but those who came seemed more committed, understanding now that this would be a hunt of elimination rather than instant discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil had spent the intervening days developing his own ground-reading methods. While William focused on signs and Sarel on patterns, Gil had become interested in what the stones themselves could tell. He'd tested every type of stone around Big Verde, learning how each held and released heat.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Granite holds longest," he'd shared. "Sandstone breathes. Fire-rock burns hot, cools fast."
            </p>
            <p>
            Now, as they approached the canyon territory, the landscape transformed from familiar desert to something more austere. Red stone rose from the earth in layers, carved by ancient floods into fantastic shapes. The plants grew sparser—tough shrubs clinging to cracks, the occasional juniper twisted by wind.
            </p>
            <p>
            "There," their roadrunner scout announced, returning from her search. "Half-sun ahead. Narrow entrance, opens wider inside. And..." she paused, ruffling her feathers. "It's shadow-deep in there. True dark."
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 1: Descent into Stone</div>
            <p>
            The slot canyon's entrance was a crack in the earth, barely wide enough for two creatures to pass side by side. The red stone walls rose thirty lengths on either side, their surfaces worn smooth by countless flash floods. As they entered, the heat dropped immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Oh," breathed a young iguana. "It's cool. Truly cool."
            </p>
            <p>
            William was already marking measurements. "Twenty degree difference from surface heat. Moisture up by fifteen counts. Light levels..." He squinted at his scratch-marks. "Approximately one-tenth of open territory."
            </p>
            <p>
            The canyon widened as they progressed, opening into a chamber perhaps fifty lengths long and twenty wide. The walls curved up and in, creating an almost den-like atmosphere. Shade was complete here—not the dappled, shifting shade of trees but the permanent shadow of stone.
            </p>
            <p>
            "It's perfect," someone whispered. "Look at all this territory. And so cool..."
            </p>
            <p>
            But Sarel noticed Gil had stopped at the entrance, running his claws along the stone with unusual focus. "What do you feel?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Heat," he said simply. "Old heat. Trapped."
            </p>
            <p>
            William looked up from his notes. "Stored? But it's cool now."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Now," Gil agreed. "Morning. After clouds. But these walls..." He pressed his entire body against the stone, sensing with more than just his claws. "They remember yesterday's heat. And the sun before. And the sun before."
            </p>
            <p>
            "You're saying the stone stores heat?" Sarel's quick mind was already racing ahead. "Like stored prey?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Mmmph. Come high-sun, will release. Slowly first. Then faster."
            </p>
            <p>
            William's excitement at finding perfect shade began to curdle. "We need to test this. Set up watching points. Track heat changes throughout a full sun cycle."
            </p>
            <p>
            They spread through the canyon, each taking memory or physical marks. The territory was indeed impressive—room for their entire community with space left over. Small ledges in the walls could serve as cache spots. The sandy floor was soft beneath paws and scales. And the blessed coolness...
            </p>
            <p>
            "Flood marks," the old tortoise observed, pointing with one ancient claw. "See? High on the walls. This place drowns."
            </p>
            <p>
            William hurried over, measuring the flood line. "Six lengths above ground level. That's... that's death-level flooding."
            </p>
            <p>
            "But it hasn't rained significantly in many moon-cycles," someone protested.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Doesn't need to rain here," Sarel explained, her desert wisdom serving them well. "Slot canyons collect water from far territories. A storm in the high places, and this becomes a death trap."
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 2: The Heat Reveals Itself</div>
            <p>
            They settled in to observe through the sun's cycle, and what they discovered turned initial excitement into growing concern. Gil had been right—the stone walls were heat-holders, absorbing warmth during the day and releasing it slowly.
            </p>
            <p>
            By high-sun, despite the shade, the canyon had warmed noticeably. By heat-peak, it was stifling. The stone radiated heat from all sides, turning what had been a refuge into a furnace. The narrow shape that provided such complete shade also trapped hot air, preventing wind-flow.
            </p>
            <p>
            "It's worse than outside," William reported, his voice tight. He'd been taking measurements obsessively, watching his hopes destroyed by numbers. "The air-heat in here is now five degrees higher than open territory. And climbing."
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil pressed against various stones, reading their heat like others might read tracks. "Sandstone worst," he shared. "Holds heat, releases slow. These walls..." He gestured at the soaring red stone. "All sandstone."
            </p>
            <p>
            "So dawn would be cool, but high-sun unbearable," Sarel summarized. "And unlike surface heat, we can't escape this by finding more shade. The shade itself holds the problem."
            </p>
            <p>
            One of the iguanas, who'd been scouting deeper in the canyon, returned at speed. "There's another danger. The canyon narrows further in. Like a trap-neck. If flooding happened..."
            </p>
            <p>
            They investigated and found her warning true. The canyon's shape was a perfect flood funnel. Water would rush through the narrow entrance, gain speed in the main chamber, then compress through the trap-neck with killing force.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Death trap," Gil concluded. "Beautiful death trap."
            </p>
            <p>
            William sat heavily on a warm stone, his markings scattered around him. "Two territories, two failures. At this rate, we'll eliminate every option in the desert before finding anything suitable."
            </p>
            <p>
            "No," Sarel corrected. "Two territories, two lessons. We're learning what doesn't work and why. That's valuable."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Valuable?" William's voice cracked. "How is failure valuable?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Because now we know to check heat-holding," Sarel explained patiently. "We know to evaluate flood risks even in dry times. We're building a more complete understanding of what we need."
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 3: Expanding Criteria</div>
            <p>
            The journey back to Big Verde was quiet but productive. William, despite his disappointment, couldn't help refining his markings based on the sun's discoveries. His initial simple pattern had evolved into something more complex.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Safety measures," he muttered, adding a new section. "Flood risk tracking. Heat-holding evaluation. Escape paths." He paused, then added: "Community sense of territory comfort."
            </p>
            <p>
            "That last one doesn't sound very number-based," Sarel observed.
            </p>
            <p>
            "No," William admitted. "But the young iguana who said it felt wrong? She sensed something before our measurements confirmed it. Maybe... maybe instinct matters too."
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil had been quiet since leaving the canyon, but now he spoke. "Need to sense places, not just measure. Stones speak. Ground speaks. We need to listen better."
            </p>
            <p>
            This was practically a speech from Gil, and his friends paid attention.
            </p>
            <p>
            "You're suggesting we add instinct-reading to our method?" William asked, clearly struggling with the concept.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Mmmph. Numbers good. Senses good. Both better."
            </p>
            <p>
            Over the following sunrises, they integrated these new understandings into their search methods. Gil trained volunteers in his ground-sensing techniques. William created space on his markings for "sense observations." Sarel developed a quick danger-check that scouts could run through immediately upon arrival at any territory.
            </p>
            <p>
            The canyon failure had also revealed something about their group. Those who'd participated in the expedition shared their knowledge eagerly, teaching others what to watch for. The roadrunner scout had begun training other swift-runners in efficient search patterns. The old tortoise started an informal dusk gathering, sharing wayfinding techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We're becoming actual scouts," William marveled one dusk, watching a training session. "Not just searchers, but... territory-readers. Knowledge-hunters even."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Desert students," Sarel agreed. "Learning to read our world more carefully."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Two failures," Gil added. "Many lessons. Fair trade."
            </p>
            <p>
            William had to admit the logic. Each failed territory taught them something essential. The ironwood wash: shade must overlap and last. The slot canyon: safety trumps comfort, and heat-flow matters as much as shade coverage.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Next territory?" someone asked during the dusk gathering.
            </p>
            <p>
            "The pack-rat middens," Sarel decided. "Different challenge entirely. Testing for space and group-living."
            </p>
            <p>
            "I'll need new markings," William said automatically, then caught himself. "Actually... I think the current patterns will work. We just need to apply them thoughtfully."
            </p>
            <p>
            It was a small sign of growth—William learning that perfect patterns mattered less than flexible thinking. The desert was teaching them all, one failed territory at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
            As they prepared for the third search, the mood was different than before. Not desperate hope or blind optimism, but determined hunting. They were building a way of survival, idea by idea, test by test.
            </p>
            <p>
            The slot canyon stood empty in the desert, beautiful and deadly, waiting for the next flood to scour it clean. But the creatures of Big Verde carried its lessons with them—carved into their understanding as surely as water carves stone. They were learning to look beyond surface beauty to deeper truths.
            </p>
            <p>
            And in the harsh teaching-ground of the desert, that learning might just save their lives.
