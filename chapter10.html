            Three failures. The count burrowed into William's thoughts as they prepared for the fourth expedition. Three carefully planned, systematically executed searches that had yielded nothing but knowledge of what wouldn't work. His latest forms had a new section labeled "Reasons for Rejection," and it was becoming depressingly comprehensive.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Maybe we're approaching this wrong," he chittered for the fifth time since dawn, reorganizing his pack yet again. "Maybe there's some variable we're not considering, some factor that—"
            </p>
            <p>
            "William," Sarel interrupted gently. "The methodology is sound. Sometimes the answer is simply 'keep looking.'"
            </p>
            <p>
            But even Sarel's usual confidence seemed strained. The community's initial enthusiasm for their scientific approach had waned with each failed expedition. Fewer volunteers came forward. More creatures talked about adapting to Big Verde's limitations rather than seeking alternatives.
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil said nothing, but his presence was steadier than ever. He'd positioned himself where discouraged creatures would pass, offering his steady presence through proximity alone. His deliberate blinks and occasional "Mmmph" conveyed more certainty than any speech.
            </p>
            <p>
            The pack-rat middens were their most unusual target yet. According to an ancient desert rat who'd joined their community after the branch fell, massive middens existed to the northwest—structures built up over generations, creating what he described as "galleries of shade."
            </p>
            <p>
            "My great-great-grandmother lived there," he'd insisted. "Whole colonies. Cool and dark inside. Protected from everything."
            </p>
            <p>
            It sounded too good to be true, which perhaps should have been a warning.
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 1: Signs of Habitation</div>
            <p>
            The journey to the middens took them through country none had explored before. The familiar saguaros gave way to a forest of jumping cholla, their segments scattered across the ground like spine-covered snares. William stopped twice to extract spines from his paws, each pause tightening his quills with frustration.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Hostile territory," he muttered. "Even the plants want us to turn back."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Or they're protecting something," Sarel suggested, though her optimism sounded forced.
            </p>
            <p>
            Their roadrunner scout had been ranging ahead as usual, but she returned more frequently, her reports increasingly puzzling. "Structures ahead, definitely. Big ones. But..." She flicked her tail feathers in agitation. "There's movement. Lots of movement."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Pack rats," William said. "We expect them to be occupied. The question is whether there's room for us too."
            </p>
            <p>
            But the roadrunner's expression suggested more concern than simple occupancy. "It's the scale of movement. Like... like a city."
            </p>
            <p>
            They crested a rise and saw what she meant. The middens were indeed massive—some rising fifteen feet high, intricate structures of sticks, cacti segments, and countless found objects built up over decades. But they were also very, very active.
            </p>
            <p>
            Pack rats darted everywhere. Not scattered residents, but dozens, perhaps hundreds. The structures that had promised communal shelter were clearly already at capacity.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Oh," William said quietly. "They're... occupied."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Extremely occupied," Sarel agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil studied the scene with his usual patience. "No room," he concluded. "No welcome either."
            </p>
            <p>
            Indeed, their approach had been noticed. Pack rats began gathering at the edges of their territory, chittering warnings. These weren't the scattered individuals they knew from around Big Verde. This was an established civilization with its own boundaries and clear opinions about visitors.
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 2: Diplomatic Failure</div>
            <p>
            Sarel, ever the diplomat, slithered forward slowly. "Greetings," she called. "We come in peace, seeking only to learn about your impressive homes."
            </p>
            <p>
            A large pack rat, clearly dominant, emerged from the largest midden. His whiskers showed seasons of age, his black eyes glittered with wariness and calculation.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Learn?" he chittered. "Or take? We know about Big Verde's troubles. Every creature in the desert knows. You seek new homes because you failed to maintain your old one."
            </p>
            <p>
            The accusation stung because it held a grain of truth. William bristled, his quills rattling. "We didn't fail. A storm—"
            </p>
            <p>
            "A storm you didn't prepare for," the pack rat interrupted. "We've weathered a thousand storms. Our homes grow stronger with each one. Yours fell at the first real test."
            </p>
            <p>
            "We're not here to take anything," Sarel insisted. "We're simply exploring options—"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Exploring how to move into what we've built? How to benefit from our generations of work?" The pack rat's tail lashed. "We've heard this before. 'Just looking.' 'Just learning.' Then comes 'just sharing.' Then 'just taking.'"
            </p>
            <p>
            The diplomatic mission deteriorated from there. More pack rats emerged, forming a defensive line. Their message was clear: these middens were theirs, had always been theirs, would always be theirs. No refugees welcome.
            </p>
            <p>
            William tried to salvage something from the encounter, pulling out his forms. "Could you at least tell us about construction techniques? Temperature regulation methods? We're developing a scientific—"
            </p>
            <p>
            A young pack rat darted forward and snatched his form, shredding it with practiced incisors before anyone could react. "There's your science," the elder rat said. "Now leave."
            </p>
            <p>
            They retreated with as much dignity as they could manage, which wasn't much. Behind them, the pack rat city buzzed with activity and gossip about the failed invasion from Big Verde.
            </p>
            <p>
            "That went well," William said bitterly once they were out of earshot.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We learned something," Sarel offered weakly.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Yes. We learned that even if we locate ideal shelter, it might already belong to others who guard their boundaries." William's voice cracked. "Four sites. Four failures. How many more before we admit this is hopeless?"
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 3: The Weight of Failure</div>
            <p>
            The journey back was the quietest yet. Even the roadrunner's usual energetic scouting seemed subdued. The weight of repeated failure pressed on them like the afternoon heat.
            </p>
            <p>
            William walked apart from the others, his mind churning. Each failed site had made sense at the time. Each had seemed to offer hope. But hope, it seemed, was just mathematics that hadn't been properly calculated. How many more sites could they test before resources ran out? Before community support evaporated entirely? Before they had to accept that Big Verde, damaged and insufficient, was all they had?
            </p>
            <p>
            "Stopping for water," Gil announced, veering toward a small seep they'd marked on the outward journey.
            </p>
            <p>
            They gathered around the tiny water source, taking turns drinking. The water was warm and tasted of minerals, but it was wet. William's mind turned to calculations: if this was the only water between Big Verde and the middens, how many creatures could it sustain? For how many days? The tallies offered no comfort.
            </p>
            <p>
            "I can't do this anymore," he said suddenly. "The planning, the hope, the crushing disappointment when reality doesn't match our theories. I can't."
            </p>
            <p>
            "William—" Sarel began.
            </p>
            <p>
            "No!" His quills bristled to full extension. "Don't tell me about valuable lessons or refined methodology. We're not scientists discovering great truths. We're desperate animals grasping at mirages."
            </p>
            <p>
            The outburst shocked everyone, including William himself. He was the planner, the organizer, the one who found comfort in systems and process. To hear him reject it all...
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil shifted forward. Not quickly—Gil never moved quickly—but with deliberation. He planted himself directly before William, holding his gaze.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Four sites tested," he said slowly. "Hundreds not tested. Give up at four?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "It's not about the number—" William started.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Is," Gil interrupted. "Everything is numbers to you. So count right. Count sites not tested. Count creatures still hoping. Count friends not quitting."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Count the days until the real heat comes," William shot back. "Count the water we don't have. Count the shade that shrinks daily. Count—"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Count one thing," Gil rumbled with certainty. "Count tomorrow. Just one. Can you survive one tomorrow?"
            </p>
            <p>
            William wanted to argue, to spiral into his catastrophic calculations. But Gil's steady gaze held him. One tomorrow. Not the whole season. Not the success of their entire mission. Just one more day.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Yes," he admitted quietly. "One more tomorrow."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Then we continue," Gil said simply. "One tomorrow at a time."
            </p>
            <p>
            Sarel had been quiet during this exchange, but now she spoke. "There's something else. A rumor I've been hesitant to share because it seems so unlikely. But..." She looked at her dejected friends. "There are accounts of a mesquite bosque. Far to the west. A full sun's journey, perhaps two."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Stories," William said flatly. "Like the stories about the middens?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Different stories," Sarel insisted. "Multiple sources. Consistent details. A place where mesquite trees grow so thick their canopies merge. Where water runs near the surface. Where—"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Where dreams come true and everyone lives happily ever after?" William's bitterness hadn't fully faded.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Where previous expeditions have failed to return from," Sarel finished quietly. "Which could mean danger. Or..."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Or they stayed," Gil completed.
            </p>
            <p>
            The possibility hung between them like pollen drifting in late light. A place so good that creatures chose not to return. It seemed impossible. It probably was impossible. But...
            </p>
            <p>
            "One more," William said finally. "One more expedition. But this time..." He looked at his scattered forms, his careful methodologies. "This time we go with more than measurements. We go ready to stay if it's real."
            </p>
            <p>
            "All of us?" someone asked.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Scout team first," Sarel decided. "But prepared for a longer journey. And if it's real, if it's truly viable..."
            </p>
            <p>
            "We move," Gil said. "All move. Together."
            </p>
            <p>
            It was a bigger risk than anything they'd attempted. Not just a day trip to test and return, but a real journey into the unknown. The kind their ancestors had made, following water and seasons and hope.
            </p>
            <p>
            As they completed their return to Big Verde, the air between them had shifted again. Not to optimism—they'd learned that led to disappointment. Not to despair—Gil's steady wisdom had headed that off. But to something more sustainable: determination mixed with acceptance.
            </p>
            <p>
            Four failures had taught them the desert's lessons: Shade must persist. Safety matters. Existing communities won't always welcome refugees. But the biggest lesson was simpler: Keep going. One tomorrow at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
            The mesquite bosque might be another illusion. Probably was. But they would test it with all their accumulated knowledge, all their refined methods, and—importantly—all their hard-won resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
            "New forms?" Sarel asked William as Big Verde came into sight.
            </p>
            <p>
            "No," he decided. "The same forms. But with a new section."
            </p>
            <p>
            "What section?"
            </p>
            <p>
            William thought for a moment. "Hope," he said finally. "Realistic hope. The kind that survives contact with reality."
            </p>
            <p>
            It wasn't scientific. It wasn't measurable. But after four failures, they were learning that not everything important could be captured in careful documentation. Sometimes survival required something more than data.
            </p>
            <p>
            Sometimes it required the wisdom to keep moving when every calculation counseled stillness.
