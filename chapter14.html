            <p>
            The desert at dusk painted itself in shades of rose and gold, beautiful enough to make them forget danger. They'd made good progress after descending the ridge, finding a wash that provided both cover and easier walking. Spirits ran higher than they'd been since leaving Big Verde—they'd survived the mirages, found water, proven they could overcome the impossible together.
            </p>
            <p>
            William was updating his journey log, adding notes about optimal travel formations and hydration schedules, when Sarel slithered up beside him with unusual urgency.
            </p>
            <p>
            "We're being followed," she said quietly, not wanting to panic the others yet.
            </p>
            <p>
            William's quill stopped mid-notation, a drop of precious ink spattering the parchment. "Followed? By what?"
            </p>
            <p>
            "Coyotes. At least two, possibly more. The roadrunner spotted them on our back trail an hour ago. They're maintaining distance but matching our pace."
            </p>
            <p>
            The warmth drained from William's body despite the evening heat, his quills beginning an involuntary rattle. Coyotes—clever, patient hunters. A group their size, with young and elderly, would present irresistible prey to a hungry pack.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Gil knows?" William asked.
            </p>
            <p>
            "He felt them before we saw them. Through the ground—their pawfalls create a different vibration pattern than desert creatures." Sarel's expression was grim. "He's already adjusting our formation, pulling the vulnerable to the center without alarming them."
            </p>
            <p>
            William looked back at their group with new eyes. What had appeared as natural travel adjustments now revealed itself as defensive positioning. Gil had the smallest creatures surrounded by larger ones. The strongest adults formed an outer perimeter. All done so gradually that most hadn't noticed.
            </p>
            <p>
            "What do we do?" William's voice cracked slightly.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Find a defensible position for the night. Set watches. Hope they're just curious." Sarel's tone suggested she didn't believe the last part.
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 1: Choosing Ground</div>
            <p>
            As full darkness approached, the need for shelter became critical. They couldn't simply stop in the open wash—that would make them easy targets. But the desert offered few perfect defensive positions.
            </p>
            <p>
            "There," Gil rumbled, pointing with his blunt snout toward a cluster of rocks rising from the wash's bank. "High ground. Walls at back. One approach."
            </p>
            <p>
            It wasn't ideal—the rocks were scattered rather than solid, leaving gaps a determined coyote could exploit. But it was better than nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Everyone stay calm," Sarel announced as they altered course. "We're stopping early tonight. Good defensive position ahead."
            </p>
            <p>
            Some of the sharper creatures understood immediately. Ears swiveled backward, listening for pursuit. Mothers pulled children closer. The elderly moved with renewed energy, fear overcoming exhaustion.
            </p>
            <p>
            They reached the rocks as the last light faded. William immediately began organizing defensive positions, his mind racing through scenarios. "Smallest in the deepest crevices. Fighters—do we have fighters?—on the perimeter. We need to block these gaps with something..."
            </p>
            <p>
            "With us," Gil said simply, already positioning himself at the largest gap. His bulk and fierce claws would give any coyote pause.
            </p>
            <p>
            The roadrunner, who'd been scouting continuously, zipped in with an update. "Four coyotes now. They've stopped about forty body-lengths out. Just... watching."
            </p>
            <p>
            "They'll wait for us to sleep," an old ground squirrel said, voice trembling like dry leaves. "Pick off whoever's on watch first, then—"
            </p>
            <p>
            "No one will be picked off," Sarel interrupted firmly. "We set watches, we stay alert, we protect each other. This is why we traveled as a group."
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 2: The Long Watch</div>
            <p>
            William found himself organizing the watch schedule, his mathematical mind calculating optimal rotations. Four watches through the night, three watchers per shift, positioned for maximum coverage. He was assigning others when his own voice emerged, surprising even him:
            </p>
            <p>
            "I'll take first watch."
            </p>
            <p>
            Everyone stared. William, anxious William who startled at shadows, volunteering for the most dangerous shift?
            </p>
            <p>
            "You need sleep for tomorrow's planning," Sarel said diplomatically.
            </p>
            <p>
            "No." William's voice was stronger now. "I organized this schedule. I should take the same risks I'm asking of others." He paused, then added more quietly, "Besides, I won't sleep anyway. Might as well be useful."
            </p>
            <p>
            Gil studied him for a long moment, then nodded. "Will watch with you. And..." He looked around, selecting. "Young iguana. Good eyes."
            </p>
            <p>
            The young iguana—the same one who'd helped build Patchwork Place so long ago—stepped forward with nervous pride. "I can do it."
            </p>
            <p>
            As the rest of the group settled for sleep, the three watchers took their positions. William at the north gap, the iguana on a high rock with the best vantage, Gil at the main approach. The desert night closed around them, full of small sounds that might be wind or might be stalking predators.
            </p>
            <p>
            "I see them," the iguana whispered after an hour. "Eyes reflecting starlight like cold sparks. They're closer."
            </p>
            <p>
            William's every instinct screamed at him to hide, to burrow deep and wait for danger to pass. His paws trembled, quills rattling softly. Instead, he forced himself to stand taller, to project presence he didn't feel. "Let them see us watching. Predators prefer easy prey."
            </p>
            <p>
            But the coyotes displayed desert patience. They circled slowly, testing different angles, searching for weakness. One grew bold enough to approach within ten body-lengths, visible in the starlight as a lean shadow with eyes that caught and held light like ice.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Hold position," Gil rumbled when the iguana started to panic. "Not attacking. Testing."
            </p>
            <p>
            William found himself counting breaths again, using the technique that had saved him on the mirage field. One breath, two breaths, three. Between counts, he gathered small rocks, piling them within easy reach. If the coyotes charged...
            </p>
            <p>
            A sound from the sleeping group—a kit whimpering in dreams. Instantly, two coyotes oriented toward it, ears pricking forward, bodies coiling with predatory interest. William's count faltered, his heartbeat hammering against his ribs. They were going to attack. They were going to—
            </p>
            <p>
            "No." The word erupted as a snarl William didn't know his throat could produce. He grabbed a rock and hurled it with all his might, his aim guided more by protective fury than skill. It struck near the bold coyote, sending up a spray of sand and gravel.
            </p>
            <p>
            The coyotes retreated several body-lengths, surprised by the aggression from prey they'd marked as weak. William stood quivering, his whole body vibrating with adrenaline, amazed at the fierce sound that had emerged from his own throat.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Good," Gil approved. "Show strength. Make them recalculate."
            </p>
            <div class="part-divider">Part 3: Community Defense</div>
            <p>
            The first watch ended without attack, but the coyotes remained, patient as death. The second watch took over—three adults who'd volunteered despite exhaustion. William should have slept but found himself helping Gil reinforce their defenses.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Pile stones here," Gil instructed, showing how to narrow the gaps without blocking them entirely. "Need escape routes too. Never trap yourself."
            </p>
            <p>
            They worked quietly, efficiently. William's engineering mind engaged fully now, seeing their position as a problem to solve rather than a terror to endure. Block this approach, funnel attackers there, create noise makers from dried seedpods that would rattle with the slightest disturbance...
            </p>
            <p>
            "You've changed," Gil observed during a pause.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Have I?" William considered. "I suppose... I'm tired of being afraid. We've come so far, survived so much. I won't let coyotes take that away."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Mmmph," Gil agreed. "Fear is information. Panic is death. You're learning difference."
            </p>
            <p>
            Sarel took the third watch, along with two others. Her snake senses and quick movements made her ideal for night defense. William finally dozed, but woke to her urgent hiss.
            </p>
            <p>
            "They're moving. Coordinating."
            </p>
            <p>
            The coyotes had decided. They approached from three angles simultaneously, testing the defenses. Not a full attack yet—still probing—but their movements carried new purpose, muscles coiled beneath dusty fur.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Wake everyone," Sarel commanded. "Quietly. We need all eyes."
            </p>
            <p>
            What followed was controlled chaos. Creatures woke to danger, but instead of panic, they found positions. The community that had learned to travel together now learned to defend together. Rocks were thrown. Threatening displays made. The young protected by bodies of the old.
            </p>
            <p>
            William found himself in the thick of it, using his quills as weapons he'd never imagined they could be. When a coyote feinted at their weakest gap, he was there, quills extended in a bristling shield, rattling them in sharp bursts while snarling with newfound ferocity.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Together!" Sarel called. "Make noise! Show them we're too much trouble!"
            </p>
            <p>
            The defense worked—barely. The coyotes made several more probing attacks, but each met unified resistance. As dawn painted the eastern sky pale pink, the pack finally retreated, deciding this prey was too organized, too alert, too costly.
            </p>
            <p>
            "They're leaving," the roadrunner reported from her dawn patrol. "Heading north, tails low. We're safe."
            </p>
            <p>
            Relief flooded through the group like water through a dry wash. Creatures who'd been rigid with fear for hours suddenly sagged with exhaustion. But pride mingled with the relief—they'd faced predators and survived through cooperation.
            </p>
            <p>
            "William," the young iguana said, approaching shyly. "That rock you threw... that was amazing. I didn't know you could be so fierce."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Neither did I," William admitted. He examined his paws, still trembling from adrenaline and exhaustion, dust ground deep into his paw pads. "I suppose we don't know what we can do until we have to do it."
            </p>
            <p>
            As they prepared for the day's travel, the night's events had clearly changed the group dynamic. They weren't just traveling companions anymore—they were a community that had defended each other. The coyote threat had forged them together in a way shared hardship alone couldn't.
            </p>
            <p>
            "Tonight we travel in tighter formation," Sarel decided. "And we maintain watches even while moving. They might follow again."
            </p>
            <p>
            "Let them," someone said with newfound confidence. "We know how to handle them now."
            </p>
            <p>
            William updated his logs with defensive positions and watch rotations, but also with something less quantifiable—notes about courage discovered in necessity, about community strength multiplying individual capabilities. He'd volunteered for first watch expecting terror. He'd found something else instead: the knowledge that he could act despite fear, that protecting others could override self-preservation.
            </p>
            <p>
            The sun rose on a group transformed. Still tired, still far from their destination, but no longer just fleeing creatures. They were a pack of their own now, bound by shared defense and mutual courage.
            </p>
            <p>
            And William, who'd spent so much of his life counting fears, had finally learned to count on something better—the strength that came from standing watch for those you traveled with, even when every instinct screamed to burrow deep and hide.
